# Star Charts Website
## Goal
I propose to create a Flask web application and website where users can obtain a star chart of the night sky. From any one location on Earth the stars and constellations visible in the night sky change over time. This change is due to the rotation of the Earth on its axis and its orbit around the Sun. Therefore, an accurate and undistorted star chart must take into account the location of the observer and the date and time of the observations. My application will generate star charts for users that accurately depict and label prominent astronomical objects and constellations visible the users location.

## Users and Data
Everyone on Earth is a potential user of this site.
The application will use astronomical data that includes the position of the stars and planets in the night sky, and the names of astronomical objects such as stars and constellations.
I would like the website to appeal to all users, but there is an historical bias in the names of constellations and stars that does not take into account the names given to astronomical objects by cultures outside of the European and Arabic star naming system. If the data is available, I would like to add these "alternative" star and constellation names to the star charts that my application generates.

In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:
a. What does your database schema look like?
b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
d. What functionality will your app include?
e. What will the user flow look like?
f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
